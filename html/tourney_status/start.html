Hello,

We're sorry to tell that you don't get to play in {I_TOURNEY_NAME} {I_SEASON_NAME}.
We try to take in as much players as we can, but it's not possible that everybody can take place in the tournament.

We still hope that you'll keep an eye on our pages ({I_URL}),
since the next season might be starting right after {I_SEASON_NAME}
and being quick you can get the chance to play in it.

Respectfully,

the {I_TOURNEY_NAME} {I_SEASON_NAME} administrators
